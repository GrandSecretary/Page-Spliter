# Page Spliter

A program that will help you with time management and make it easier to absorb the material you need to read (or it may not be just pages). You have to admit, reading the entire outline for tomorrow is not effective if you can divide the pages by day, right?

# Functionality

The first thing you need to do is add the subject you want to read. After you click on "Add", a window will pop up. You will have three text boxes. First is for subject name, you can name whatever you want. Next is page count. I think you know for what it is. Last is Deadline. You should enter the date after today. Date format is DD.MM.YYYY. After pressing "Apply", the new subject will apprear in the first list box on the left. If you select it, in another list on the right, you will see "objectives" for each day, up to and not including the deadline.

## Complete
After selecting the objective from the list on the right, you will be able to press "Complete" button. After application the objective will be marked as "Done". Everything is simple.

## Edit
You can edit the selected subject. After applying it, a window will pop up similar to the one you'd see if you'd created a subject recently. All you need to do is edit the parameters.

## Delete
If you no longer want a particular subject to appear in the list, you can delete it. Just select the item, click "Delete" and confirm.

## Spread
There are times when you may miss a day with pages for some reason. You can catch up on the missed day, but then you'll have read the pages in 2 days Or you can just spread out the missed pages. By clicking "Spread", you spread the pages over the following days.

## Save
Just saving the changes you've made
